I have around 14 years of experience in Devops. Yes, you read it right. All 14 years, I have worked in the area of Devops and I'll continue to work in the same domain with the same passion.
I am a **Docker Certified Associate** and a **Associate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect**

I feel, **Devops** is the most abused word in the current Software Industry. Being in this profession for many years, I have seen the transition & evolution in this domain very closely. It was a continuous change/evolution interms of process/automation/tools/technology and it will continue to change/evolve.
So, the term 'Devops' is may be coined few years back, but it is not got created overnight and also, it is not something/entriely new.
However, I don't say it's a old wine in a new bottle. Becuase, definitely it has got a new flavor and rich in energy:)

## My Background and Journey in Devops

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Communication in the Year 2006 and joined a startup in Bangalore which was mainly in to product developemt and services, also a channel partner of IBM. I got to work on few IBM tools and support customers with training & implemention of those tools. Mainly, I worked on Rational ClearCase & some kind of automation scripting using Perl for Rational Purify Plus product.

In 2007, I joined 'Siemens India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore' as Build & Release engineer. Here I got more exposure on the build and releases *processes* for multiple products (Legacy as well as new product developement). Along with Version Control Management & processes associated with it, I also got an opportunity improve my scripting skill (especially in Perl).

After working for Siemens about 3.5 years, I joined Philips India Ltd, bangalore in 2011. Here, I got an opportunity to work for multiple Buisiness Units for multiple Projects which were quite diverse in nature in terms of technology and processes. Initially, I worked on TFS (Team Foundation Server, it is now called as Azure Devops) implementaion and customation like defining Work Items workflow, defining commit policies etc. In later part of my carreer with Philips, I worked mainly on setting up CI/CD processes, defining Jenkins Piplelines etc. Also, I worked on a major Devops project called 'Atlantis', where the goal was to restructure the monolothic source archive to independent release modules (like Microservices, but not exactly) and improve the build performance (reduce the system build time). I also worked on couple of the POCs for containerizing some analytic products using Docker and Kubernetes

After 7 years of stint at Philips, I joined Oracle India Pvt Ltd bangalore, in July 2018. Here we use our own tools stack for CI/CD and build processes, which is well implemented.
CI/CD framework and many other utilities are developed in PHP. We mantain & enhance these utilities. For any new automation requirements, we use Python. For software configuration for all our build servers, I introduced and implemented Ansible. Oracle introduced it's own cloud solution called 'OCI' (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) and mandated all projects and internal infra to migarate to OCI. I was involved in migrating all our build infra and CI/CD process to OCI.

For an internal QA framework/application, I have implemented a server monitoring solution using **Prometheus & Grafana**.

As part of my continous learning Journey, I attended trainings on Docker & Kubernetes. I have developed few applications to demonstarte the Docker & Kubernetes workflow. I have taken few training sessions internally for other team members. Also, I have conducted couple of trainings on Docker for a start up. To make this journey more exciting, attempted for Docker certification and became **Docker Certified Associate** in November 2020.

I had completed **AWS Solution Architect** course from SimpliLearn in 2017. But, I haven't got a chance to attempt for AWS certification. Since, in Oracle we use OCI(Oracle Cloud Infrastructure), thought I should attempt for OCI certification. In April 2021, I got certified as **Associate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect**.

So to conclude, when I started my carreer as a build & release engineer, many people in Software Industry did not know what is 'Build & release' all about. Now, everyone knows what is Devops and what Devops professional would do. Finding/defining who are Devops professionals and what exactly they have to/can do is something we need to get a clarity going forward in this journey. After spending these many years in this domain, I have many skills in my kitty. Devops has become so vast with so many tools and technologies to learn. The list is going bigger and bigger. I have learnt and mastered some of those tools & technologies. I am happy & proud to be DevOpsian.
