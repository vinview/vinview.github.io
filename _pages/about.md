I have around 14 years of experience in Devops. Yes, you read it right. All 14 years, I have worked in the area of Devops and I'll continue to work in the same domain with the same passion or bit more.
I feel, 'Devops' is the most abused word in the current Software Industry. Being in this profession for many years, I have seen the transition & evolution in this domain so closely. It's a continuous change/evolution interms of process/automation/tools/technology and it will continue to change/evolve.
So, the term 'Devops' is may be coined few years back, but it is not got created overnight and it is not something/entriely new also.
But, I don't say it's a old wine new bottle also. Becuase, definitely it has got a new flavor and more energy:)

There are so many profession and processes other than actual Development and Opertaions. For example, Testing/QA, Quality & Assurance, Buisiness Analysts, PMOs etc. All these, come under devops (as they are neither devoplement nor opertaions and somewhere they contribute in both)? May be not! It's debatable.
