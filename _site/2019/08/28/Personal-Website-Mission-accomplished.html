<p class="text-justify">As an undergrad, I learned some basic HTML and CSS and created a simple webpage in a class project. I haven’t thought back then that I would have a fully functional personal website one day with all the modern features like social sharing, tagging, related posts and so on.</p>

<p class="text-justify">All this became possible thanks to <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/">Michael Rose and his Minimal Mistakes</a> responsive <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> theme! I really loved the minimalistic design and the ability to customize a lot of features! The theme is also very well documented and has lots of examples. Using Markdown for writing HTML makes blogging a lot easier.</p>

<p>Another killer feature is that you can host your website on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a> for free!</p>

<p>No wonder that Minimal Mistakes is so popular. <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">It’s GitHub</a> page was forked over 9000 times and starred over 5000 times! I personally got inspiration from these people who customized MM and also blogged about the process:</p>
