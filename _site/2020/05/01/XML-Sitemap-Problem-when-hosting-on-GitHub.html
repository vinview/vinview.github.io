<p><strong>TLDR: Don’t commit your auto-generated sitemap.xml to GitHub. It won’t be updated</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-sitemap-is-important">Why sitemap is important?</h2>
<p>Sitemaps encourage crawling. So if you want your site to be “discovered” by Google, it’s better to have an up-to-date sitemap. You can check your website’s indexing state in Google Search Console by going to the Coverage tab or simply by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site:yourwebsite.com</code> in Google.</p>

<p class="notice--info text-justify"><i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> <strong>Note:</strong>  For small site’s with fewer than 500 pages and well-linked structure, sitemap is not necessary - Google will index all pages anyway. Still, it’s better to monitor the indexing “health” of your site as it grows.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I host my Minimal Mistakes Jekyll site on GitHub Pages and commit all the changes there. 
sitemap.xml is autogenerated with <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap/blob/master/Gemfile">jekyll-sitemap plugin</a></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Unindexed pages as shown in Google Search Console</p>

<p>Index Coverage report in Google Search Console gave me 1 error message and 12 pages that were indexed, but not submitted in sitemap:</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Delete sitemap.xml from GitHub</p>

<p>Building site locally showed no sitemap problems, so jekyll-plugin worked as intended. 
The problem was that I committed the sitemap.xml to GitHub Pages where I host my site. When generating the site, GitHub also generates the new sitemap.xml via jekyll-plugin. But because such file already existed (the old version that was committed earlier), it simply ignored the new version.</p>

<p>The mistake is really stupid. Hope you learned from this post not to make it.</p>
